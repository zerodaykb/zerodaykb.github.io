Welcome!

This blog covers topics related to:
- **Security**: I love technical things, manual testing, and learning how things work together. I have some background in software development, but I'm mostly enthusiastic about testing and security research.
- **Personal**: I'm a fitness and sports enthusiast. I'm a father of two boys and a member of a Christian community.

I'm OSCP+ certified and specialize in these areas:
- web application security
- network penetration testing
- mobile penetration testing
- Active Directory penetration testing

Feel free to reach me out.
