Welcome to my blog! I'm just a normal guy in love with security.

This blog covers topics related to:
- **Security**: I love technical things, manual testing and learning how things work togeter. I have a little background in software development but I'm mostly enthusiasting in testing things.
- **Personal**: I'm a fitness and sports freak. I hike mountains and do triathlon. I'm father of two boys and member of Christian community.

Feel free to reach me out via krzysztof@zerodaykb.pl for business opportunities.
