Welcome to my blog! I'm just a normal guy in love with security.

This blog covers topics related to:
- **Security**: I love technical things and manual testing. How things work togeter. I have a little background in software development and looking into code.
- **Personal**: I'm a fitness and sports freak. I hike mountains and do triathlon. I'm father of two boys and member of Christian community.
