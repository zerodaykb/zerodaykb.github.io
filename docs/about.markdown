Welcome!

This blog covers topics related to:
- **Security**: I love technical things, manual testing, and learning how things work together. I have some background in software development, but I'm mostly enthusiastic about testing and security research.
- **Personal**: I'm a fitness and sports enthusiast. I hike mountains and train triathlon. I'm a father of two boys and a member of a Christian community.

I specialize in:
- web application security
- Active Directory
- network penetration testing
- mobile penetration testing

Feel free to reach me out.
